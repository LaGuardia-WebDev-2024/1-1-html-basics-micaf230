    <h1>Balance</h1>
    
    <h2>By Mica Friedman</h2>
    
    <p>
      Not all things are heavy, <br>
      Not all things are light. <br>
      We as human beings have to decide,<br>
      What is the important, <br>
      Regardless of its weight.<br>
      But, judge too hard - <br>
      And you'll be crushed under the scale. <br>
      Grass growing greener over you.<br>
      Sadly,<br>
      Life goes on.
